<HTML><BODY>A large collection of tales from Mongolia, which has a rich Buddhist tradition.

<p>The book is fairly straightforward. You'll have to supply several accents on letters. A few cases of double accents (e.g., an o with a dieresis and a circumflex accent, which can be handled as [^ö].

<p>The footnote references are to a separate chapter of footnotes at the end of the volume. Just treat them as normal footnote references.

<p>Please drop the words "Digitized by Microsoft" from the bottom of the page, if they still appear. They will be credited for the scanning in the colophon.
