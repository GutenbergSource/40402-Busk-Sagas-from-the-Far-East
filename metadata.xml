      <dc:description>A collection of Kalmouk and Mongolian stories, that, although original derived from Indian sources, have received an entire transformation in the course of their adoption by their new country. The stories have been somewhat expurgated to meet Victorian sensitivities, and are supplemented with extensive notes.</dc:description>
